Critique of an existing Omeka project

1. What is the **message** of this Omeka project? Is there a strong thesis or argument at its core?
2. What is the **medium** of this Omeka project? Does its design effectively express relationships between visual and textual components? Does the format of the Omeka project help to advance its argument?
3. Do the **structural components** support the thesis or argument of the Omeka project? Why or why not?
4. Who is the primary **audience** of this Omeka project?
5. Does this Omeka project provide **attribution**? Does it credit sources where appropriate, and, if possible, link out to those sources? Does it acknowledge precedents and sources of inspiration?
