# Exercise 4: Discuss collaborative roles of Omeka projects

Based on the previous exercises, you should now have a pretty strong sense of what it takes to create an Omeka project. Form pairs and discuss the following questions:

1. Who are potential collaborators on your campus or in your communities?

2. What are the skills and expertise a project team would need to have to create an Omeka project?

3. What skills and expertise would you bring to an Omeka project?

4. What are possible skill gaps for which your project team might need to skill up or recruit additional members with complementary knowledge and skills?

Time permitting, we will ask pairs to share insights from their discussion with the larger group.
