## **Exercise 4 - Use Widgets and Analysis Tools (20-30 minutes)**

1.  **Widgets**

*1. Choose a layer and go into the "data" menu

*2. You will see the option to "add as a widget" the values in each column for that data table. Select a widget that you'd like to explore.

*3. For example, in the Historic Districts dataset, select "place_name" and in the Buildings dataset, select "elevation_sea_level"

*4. You will see a sidebar appear to the right of your map with the data from the column you selected as a widget.

*5. Repeat with other layers.

*6. View all of your widgets in the sidebar under "Widgets"

*    1. You can easily delete a widget

*    2. You can also edit your widget type and configure the values

*    3. If you want your widget to interact with the data â€“ set it as dynamic

*7. You'll notice that as you zoom or pan across your map, the data point totals will adjust to reflect the values that are represented by a specific widget.

2. **Analysis**

*8. Create areas of influence to identify the distance between each building (radius 10, tracts 1)

*9.  In the Buildings layer, select "analysis" and click on the + sign in "Your Workflow"

*10. Select "create areas of influence" and click on "add analysis"

*11. In "parameters" identify whether you want to use distance of time, units, radius, and tracts. Select "apply."

*12. You will notice that the icons have now disappeared and instead there will be fine points with consistent spaces.
