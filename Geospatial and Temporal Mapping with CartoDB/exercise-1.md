# **Lesson**

## **Exercise 1 - Create a basic map with points (30 - 40 minutes)**

This first exercise will be demonstrated by the instructor, step by step, and then participants will attempt to visualize this dataset and explore the Carto UI.

> <sub>1. Login to the Carto dashboard

>     1. Find "Your datasets" where you will upload new datasets.

>     2. Find "Your maps" where you will be able to see your published maps.

> <sub>2. Go to the City of Boston Open Data at:[ https://data.boston.gov/group/geospatial](https://data.boston.gov/group/geospatial), find the **Buildings** dataset and download the **CSV file.**

> <sub>3. In your Carto dashboard go to "Datasets" and click on "New Dataset"

>     3. Select your file "Buildings.csv" and click on "Connect Dataset" to upload it

>     4. Click on the dataset in your dashboard and you will be able to view the table

>     5. Find the Part_Center and Part_Center_1 columns (Q, R)

>         1. Click on the three vertical dots next to the column header "Part_Center" and select "rename column." Rename it to "Longitude."

>         2. Click on the three vertical dots next to the column header "Part_Center_1" and select "rename column." Rename it to "Latitude."

>         3. Click on "Create map" (bottom right corner)

> <sub>4. You will now see a map view with a sidebar with layers and widgets

>     6. You should see "positron labels," "buildings,", and "positron – basemap"

>     7. Your buildings map will not have any points, because it is not georeferenced.

> <sub>5. Let's georeference your map

>     8. Click on the **Buildings** layer in the sidebar and then the "georeference" button.

>     9.  In the "Parameters" section – identify the columns that contain latitude and longitude values. Click "apply."

> <sub>6. Your map now has points!

>     10. Zoom in to Boston to see the points on your map.

>     11. You'll notice that your sidebar now has additional menu items

>         4. Data, Analysis, Style, Pop-up, Legend

>         5. We will return to these items later.

>     12. Notice that you can toggle between your data table and map view in the bottom right corner of your map.

> <sub>7. Questions before moving on.
